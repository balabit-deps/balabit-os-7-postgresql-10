postgresql-10 (10.4-0ubuntu0.18.04) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #1769888)
    - A dump/restore is not required for those running 10.X.
      However, if you use the adminpack extension, you should update it as
      per the first changelog entry of the changelog.
      (CVE-2018-1115)
      Also, if the function marking mistakes mentioned in the first
      changelog entry affect you, you will want to take steps to
      correct your database catalogs.
    - Details about changes can be found at
      https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-4.html

postgresql-10 (10.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    If you run an installation in which not all users are mutually
    trusting, or if you maintain an application or extension that is
    intended for use in arbitrary situations, it is strongly recommended
    that you read the documentation changes described in the first changelog
    entry below, and take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or
    code is secure.

    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry below may
    cause functions used in index expressions or materialized views to fail
    during auto-analyze, or when reloading from a dump.  After upgrading,
    monitor the server logs for such problems, and fix affected functions.

    + Document how to configure installations and applications to guard
      against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users

      Using a search_path setting that includes any schemas writable by a
      hostile user enables that user to capture control of queries and then
      run arbitrary SQL code with the permissions of the attacked user.  While
      it is possible to write queries that are proof against such hijacking,
      it is notationally tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes.
      Therefore, we now recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas
      appear in one's search path.
      (CVE-2018-1058)

    + Avoid use of insecure search_path settings in pg_dump and other client
      programs

      pg_dump, pg_upgrade, vacuumdb and other PostgreSQL-provided applications
      were themselves vulnerable to the type of hijacking described in the
      previous changelog entry; since these applications are commonly run by
      superusers, they present particularly attractive targets.  To make them
      secure whether or not the installation as a whole has been secured,
      modify them to include only the pg_catalog schema in their search_path
      settings. Autovacuum worker processes now do the same, as well.

      In cases where user-provided functions are indirectly executed by these
      programs -- for example, user-provided functions in index expressions --
      the tighter search_path may result in errors, which will need to be
      corrected by adjusting those user-provided functions to not assume
      anything about what search path they are invoked under.  That has always
      been good practice, but now it will be necessary for correct behavior.
      (CVE-2018-1058)

postgresql-10 (10.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Fix processing of partition keys containing multiple expressions
      (CVE-2018-1052)

    + Ensure that all temporary files made by pg_upgrade are
      non-world-readable (CVE-2018-1053)

    + Change the behavior of contrib/cube's cube ~> int operator to make it
      compatible with KNN search.

      The meaning of the second argument (the dimension selector) has been
      changed to make it predictable which value is selected even when
      dealing with cubes of varying dimensionalities.

      This is an incompatible change, but since the point of the operator
      was to be used in KNN searches, it seems rather useless as-is.
      After installing this update, any expression indexes or materialized
      views using this operator will need to be reindexed/refreshed.

postgresql-10 (10.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Suppress build variability in schemapg.h.
  * Include package version number in "extra version" so it is reported by
    "psql --version" and friends.
  * postgresql-10.postinst: Ignore command-with-path-in-maintainer-script.
  * debian/rules: Set DEB_HOST_* via /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk.

postgresql-10 (10.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop dbg package in favor of dbgsym packages.
  * Reimplement /usr/bin/pg_config in perl. This makes libpq-dev cross-
    compilation friendly (Closes: #794103), and unbreaks co-installation of
    the split dbgsym packages because we previously installed the same
    pg_config twice.
  * Show package version number in version().
  * Remove actual build path from Makefile.global for reproducibility.

postgresql-10 (10.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    + Ensure that INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE checks table permissions
      and RLS policies in all cases (Dean Rasheed)

      The update path of INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE requires SELECT
      permission on the columns of the arbiter index, but it failed to check
      for that in the case of an arbiter specified by constraint name. In
      addition, for a table with row level security enabled, it failed to
      check updated rows against the table's SELECT policies (regardless of
      how the arbiter index was specified). (CVE-2017-15099)

    + Fix crash due to rowtype mismatch in json{b}_populate_recordset()
      (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

      These functions used the result rowtype specified in the FROM ... AS
      clause without checking that it matched the actual rowtype of the
      supplied tuple value.  If it didn't, that would usually result in a
      crash, though disclosure of server memory contents seems possible as
      well. (CVE-2017-15098)

    + Fix BRIN index summarization to handle concurrent table extension
      correctly (√Ålvaro Herrera)

      Previously, a race condition allowed some table rows to be omitted from
      the index.  It may be necessary to reindex existing BRIN indexes to
      recover from past occurrences of this problem.

  * Remove empty conf.d directory on purge, even when postgresql-common was
    already removed. (Closes: #877264)
  * Remove docbook-dsssl and openjade from Build-Depends, not needed anymore.

postgresql-10 (10~~devel-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream version 10; packaging based on postgresql-9.6.
  * Merge postgresql-contrib-10 package into postgresql-10. The added
    packaging complexity doesn't seem worth the split anymore given the extra
    dependencies are typically very small on average systems, or already
    installed anyway (libuuid, libxslt).
  * Enable ICU support.
